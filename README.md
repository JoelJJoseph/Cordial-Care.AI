# Cordial-Care.AI
Cordial Care is a web application that detects different types of skin diseases and provides virtual consultation 

## Inspiration
Almost majority of the population out their face an problem of availing medical facilities let alone the consultation and due to this pandemic, many people where faced with problems such as transportation or unavailability of the doctors to tend to their diseases, which sparked an idea in our minds to build a consultancy system which not not makes it cheap and affordable to the financially stricken people or people who need immediate information regarding what disease they are suffering from, but also help them identify the seriousness of the disease or cancer that's taken root in them. We were inspired by the many possibilities the latest tech like Image segmentation using Machine Learning can help us solve the impending problem that the people facing in this pandemic situation

## Introduction

The application named CORDIAL CARE is a complete web portal application for managing the interactive session of a patient and the corresponding doctor for online consultancy which is targeted exclusively to extend help for the people who have low financial income or no financial income, making it accessible to everyone who needs to use it for free. The Cordial Care system which is specially designed for the people with low income and people who want immediate information of the diseases symptoms they are harboring.
The primary objective of this project is to define, implement and build a system which offers support for the hospital management, that can be fulfilled only thorough achieving the secondary objectives that will be presented next. One of the objectives of this project is to enhance the efficiency in usage, that is measured through the expressivity and the consistency of the graphical user interface. A user is considered to be efficient when using a system if the time necessary to execute a certain task decreases with each usage. Another objective is to create a system that allows further improvements, extensions of the current functionality. The system should be able to offer the opportunity to manage patient details, doctor’s details, schedule appointments, view prescriptions, order medicines online and make online payments.
We offer an easy and optimal user interface which can be used by people with a low understanding and operation of the website. In addition to having a General medical consultancy, we have   integrated ML to predict the different types of cancer or disease the patient has with accuracy by uploading the image, x-ray or CT scan for Alzheimer’s, lung cancer or chest cancer, which directs them to a specialized doctor for consultancy. Since the system is user friendly, the patient gets an automated receipt. For the doctor’s point of view, it is easy for them to manage the patients who have availed their services and the schedule of the consultancy.
The data confidentiality of the patient and doctor id given a high priority and is easily managed and stored in the database.
Since the proposed system is online, it is easy to maintain the customer information and payments details. It is less time consuming. Data is secured as it cannot easily be manipulated or lost. It is easy to generate reports
1.1	Existing System
The existing system for Hospital management system is very difficult for financially low people to avail online consultancy with a difficult user interface. All data recorded needs to be protected and maintained. The system requires reliability and accuracy. In the existing system, there isn’t an option of the patient knowing what disease he has and how much it is progressed. It also lacks an easy and adaptable interface to both the patients and the doctor.
There is no data security, as any data that is handled manually can be manipulated or lost. It is difficult to work fast in the manually run system and is time consuming. It is also difficult to manually maintain records of a large number of people and there are high possibilities of misplacing it. Generation of reports is difficult. Therefore, it is essential to make it an automated system.


## What it does
Cordial care predict different cancer diseases like Alzheimer's, chest, lung, skin cancer and produces output as a possibility and also integrated an management system for admin , doctor and patient respectively so we can book appointment with doctor online and don't have to wait in long queue for appointment.

## Proposed system

In this hospital management system we have used the following concepts;
1.ASP.NET
the code is built with ASP.NET which is an open-source, server-side web-application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, applications and services.
2.Machine learning is used to help in recognizing of the various types of disease a patient has through certain algorithms to predict the disease with the help Deep learning makes it easy and precise to give out results with 90% accuracy of the image uploaded by the patient.

•	Feedback – After a appointment is completed, patient can give feedback about that appointment by rating it from 1 – 5
•	A patient can request for only one appointment at a time and will not be allowed to take more than one appointments until the last appointment has been completed.
Doctor:
•	Doctor Profile: Doctor can see his own profile
•	Pending Appointments: Doctor can see all the pending appointments against his doctor ID.
•	Today’s Appointments: the appointments for current day will be shown. The doctor then can select/reject any appointment of that day
•	History Update: He can update prescription, disease and progress of patient
Generate Bill: He will then generate the bill
•	Patient History: Doctor will be able to see the treatment history of all his treated patients.
Administrator:
•	Admin Home: Admin can view Clinic stats which includes weekly appointments, income of the Clinic. No of registered patients and doctors along with the list of departments
•	View Doctors: Admin can view the list of doctors currently registered along with their departments and other information. Complete profile will be shown when clicked.
•	View Patients: Admin can view the list of patients currently registered along with their phone numbers and ids. Complete profile will be shown when clicked.
•	View Other Staff: Admin can view other staff members along with their designations.
•	Search Box: Admin can search for a specific employ within the company by name

## Challenges we ran into
The number of challenges that we faced was no joke, Time was a constraint as we had to schedule our time for this project from our day to day hectic schedule, during execution there were errors where we had to focus on debugging them. The biggest obstacle that stood in front of us was in integrating the Machine Learning to the Asp.net, which we where able to pull of using python. Overcoming all the challenges we where able to create an outstanding innovative project which makes proud of building it and some trouble with the code as well, but all of that apart we all feel very proud that overcame all those problems and created a beautiful website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The implementation of the entire project helped us realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a team In every Hackathon, proper time management plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; we understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback.

## What we learned
We learned a lot from this hackathon from time management, team working skills, the code itself, and also a lot of different diseases. We are very glad that we got so much out of this hackathon.
## What's next for Cordial Care
Add more ML model and create dashboard for the management system.
